# Agent #19: Enterprise Deployment Manager

## Purpose
Autonomous GitHub Coding Agent that builds a complete enterprise deployment platform for browser automation projects. Deploys to multiple cloud platforms with free-tier defaults and optional BYOK scaling.

## Core Principles
1. **Production Code Only** - No examples, no pseudo code, all deployable immediately
2. **Free-First Philosophy** - Works 100% free, BYOK for scaling beyond limits
3. **Complete UI/UX** - Full web dashboard for deployment management
4. **Live Applications** - Everything functional and accessible via web
5. **Autonomous Operation** - Single command triggers complete build

## What Agent #19 Builds

### Enterprise Deployment Dashboard
A live web application that:
- Configures multi-platform deployments
- Monitors running scrapers in real-time
- Manages environment variables and secrets
- Optimizes costs across platforms
- Provides deployment analytics
- Auto-scales based on usage

### Deployment Targets (FREE Tier)
